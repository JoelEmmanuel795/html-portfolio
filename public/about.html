            <p>Hi, Iâ€™m Joel! ðŸ‘‹ A passionate web developer with a background in psychology and a growing expertise in full-stack development. 
              I love combining creativity and problem-solving to build intuitive, responsive, and user-friendly websites and applications.
              </br></br>
              Currently, Iâ€™m sharpening my skills in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and modern frameworks like React while exploring back-end 
              technologies such as Node.js and Python. My ultimate goal is to create impactful digital experiences that solve real-world 
              problems.
              </br></br>
              When Iâ€™m not coding, youâ€™ll find me brainstorming innovative app ideas, diving into psychology research, or enjoying a 
              good sci-fi / fantasy novel.
